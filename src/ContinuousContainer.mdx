# Continuous Container

Renderless container with a _Continuous_ State

<Props of={ContinuousContainer} />



# Common case - YES or NO

Let's imagine you have a switch. Which controls visibility of something, but you 
also want to add some animation.

Let's handle these cases separately: 

<Playground>
 {() => {
   const [on, setOn] = useState(false);
   
   return (
     <div>
       <button onClick={() => setOn(on => !on)}>Toggle</button>
       
       <p>
        the following content would be __instanly__ hidden or shown
       { on && <div>shown</div>}
       { !on && <div>hidden</div>}
       </p>               
     </div>
   )
 }}
</Playground>


<br/>
<br/>

# Improved case - YES/NO/WAS JUST A SECOND AGO

Now let's imagine you dont want to render Content when it's not visible.

Ok, "when it's not visible"? - _AnimationTimeout_ after being hidden

<Playground>
{() => {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setOn(on => !on)}>Toggle</button>
      
      <p>
         the following content would be __instanly__ shown, but hidden in a timeout
      <ContinuousContainer value={on} timeout={3000}>       
       {(past, present, future) => (
       <>         
         <ul>
           <li>past - {String(past)} - going to be delayed by 3s</li>
           <li>present - {String(present)}</li>
           <li>future - {String(future)}</li>
         </ul>
         
         {
            // display if it
            // - was displayed <300ms ago
            // - is displayed
            // - would be displayed next tick
             
            (past || present || future) 
            ? <div> { present ? 'is shown now' : 'still have to show' }</div>
            : <div>hidden</div>
         }         
       </>  
       )}
       </ContinuousContainer>
       </p>
    </div>
  )
}}
</Playground>

You dont have to use `future` in all the cases. You will figure out the right cases by your own
